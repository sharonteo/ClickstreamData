# Getting the Data
```{R}
fileLocation <- "http://stat.columbia.edu/~rachel/datasets/nyt1.csv"
data1 <- read.csv(url(fileLocation))
```

# Take a look at the first 5 rows
```{R}
head(data1)
```
# Overview of the structure of the data 
```{R}
str(data1)
```
# Task 1
# Create a new variable ageGroup that categorizes age into following groups:        < 18, 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64 and 65+.

```{R}
data1$Age_Group <- cut(data1$Age, c(-Inf, 18, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, Inf))

levels(data1$Age_Group) <- c("<18", "18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+")

```

# New age groups
```{R}
head(data1)
```

# Task 2
# Plot distributions of number impressions and click-through-rate (CTR = click/impression) for the age groups.


# Create a subset of data1 to exclude rows where there are no impressions (if there are no impressions, we assume there will be no clicks). Name the new object d1
```{R}
d1 <- subset(data1, Impressions>0)
```
# Add a column to d1 called CTR containing the click-through-rate
```{R}
d1$CTR <- d1$Clicks/d1$Impressions
head(d1)
```
# Plot the distribution of Impressions>0, grouped by Age_Group, using the ggplot2   package

```{R}
library(ggplot2) # used for visualizations
ggplot(subset(d1, Impressions>0), aes(x=Impressions, fill=Age_Group))+
    geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
```

# Plot the distribution of CTR>0, grouped by Age_Group
```{R}
ggplot(subset(d1, CTR>0), aes(x=CTR, fill=Age_Group))+
    labs(title="Click-through rate by age group (05/01/2012)")+
    geom_histogram(binwidth=.025)
```
